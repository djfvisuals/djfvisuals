    <h1>Experience</h1>

    <p>
      My creative journey began at a young age through music and art, and at 16 I started my professional career designing apparel for online platforms, 
      gaining early experience creating paid, marketable designs. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design from Florida International University 
      and continued to grow my professional experience as a digital marketing specialist and designer for Miami Alkaline Water, followed by a role as a 
      production specialist/designer. 
      I later joined Valuetainment, the #1 business podcast in America, founded by Patrick Bet-David, where I contributed to high-profile multimedia and branding projects. My work 
      includes: print and digital design, e-commerce apparel design, branding, and creative direction. I’ve built and guided clothing brands from concept to launch, as well as developed 
      my own music brand, where I lead brand strategy, art direction, and visual identity for musicians. This includes designing album covers, art directing music videos, and shaping 
      the overall brand experience. With a background in brand psychology, I approach design with an understanding of human behavior, crafting visuals that not only look compelling 
      but also connect with audiences on a deeper level. 
      This perspective naturally led me to marketing and sparked my growing expertise in UX design, allowing me to create solutions that are both visually striking and user-focused.

    <h1 class="sub-heading">Who I Am</h1>

    <p>
      As a designer, I see every project as a problem to be solved, whether it’s refining a brand’s identity, optimizing a user experience, or crafting visuals 
      that leave a lasting impression. My strength lies in identifying what’s missing, uncovering what’s holding a brand back, and designing solutions that work 
      on both an emotional and strategic level. For me, design isn’t just about aesthetics — it’s about creating experiences that are memorable, impactful, and results-driven.
